Home computer with video &amp; sound using an 8080 or 8085 single board computer

Here are screenshots of some BASIC programs taken from the LM80C repository.
They use the extended set of BASIC commands of the LM80C computer.

Sorting algorithms - [LM80C-R210-sorting-algorithms.bas](https://github.com/leomil72/LM80C/blob/master/BASIC%20examples/LM80C-R210-sorting-algorithms.bas)

In this program execution 200 numbers were sorted; 10% of the numbers are presorted. 
It would be nice to compare the runtimes with the original LM80C Z80 computer. 
Note, that the 8080 SBC runs at 2.048 MHz and that the 8080 CPU needs more 
clock periods / machine cycles to perform the instructions than the Z80.

Same demo program as before, but now only 20 numbers were sorted and 0% were ordered before.
